# RNAfold

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at honing my skills in Python and familiarizing myself with the application of ViennaRNA for RNA structure prediction. 
To achieve this, I've taken inspiration from the R code I previously developed for Chris Lauber at MHH, using it as a foundation for my Python implementation.

It's worth noting that this project is not a major undertaking but rather an exercise to facilitate my transition from R to Python. 
It serves as valuable practice to ensure a seamless switch between the two programming languages.

As part of this learning journey, I've been maintaining a 'lessons.txt' file where I document all the insights and knowledge I've gained along the way.
