First lesson: use snake case for methods, script names/modules and functions.
snake case: using all lowercase letters and separating words with underscores.
so instead of RNAfold.py use rna_fold.py for script name.
> Warning in VScode: Module name "RNAfold" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style.

lesson 2: when using anaconda create a seperate conda enviroment for each project.
That way you can load the python version and dependencies you need without dependency problems.
each package will exist only in that enviroment.
> here in install biopython only in the rna_fold enviroment.
