First lesson: use snake case for methods, script names/modules and functions.
snake case: using all lowercase letters and separating words with underscores.
so instead of RNAfold.py use rna_fold.py for script name.
> Warning in VScode: Module name "RNAfold" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style.

lesson 2: when using anaconda create a seperate conda enviroment for each project.
That way you can load the python version and dependencies you need without dependency problems.
each package will exist only in that enviroment.
> here in install biopython only in the rna_fold enviroment.

lesson 3: biopython
biopython is a bioinformatics module with a lot of functions.
Here I am using it to load fasta files into python.
> Install biopython under conda: conda install -c conda-forge biopython
> import: import Bio

lesson 4: install pandas for data manipulation and data frame usage
> conda install pandas
> import pandas as pd

lesson 5: Sequences from FASTA-files are read as <class 'Bio.Seq.Seq'>
> see print(type(virus.seq)) in code/import_fastafile.py
Need to convert them to string with str-function
virus_list.append([virus.id,str(virus.seq)])
